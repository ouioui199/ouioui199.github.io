                    <p>
                        By googling "artificial intelligence", you can easily find lots of definitions. For me, AI is a machine that reduces human efforts. I use it as a tool to ease-up automation of certain tasks, and as an interactive memory. In daily life, AI has found its place. For example, autonomous driving cars, chatbots, language translators and content recommending systems are few among these automated intelligence applications. Even this website has been built with the help of ChatGPT and Gemini.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Albert Einstein has said: "Once you stop learning, you start dying". The world is moving continuously. We are now in the cyber physical systems era, and AI is part of the revolution, along with IIoT, BigData, Cloud, etc. According to the <a href="https://aiindex.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/HAI_AI-Index-Report-2024_Chapter1.pdf">2024 Artificial Intelligence Index Report</a> published by Stanford University, the amount of AI publications nearly tripled, rising from approximately 88,000 in 2010 to more than 240,000 in 2022. This proves that AI is evolving lightning-fast. More sectors and industries are integrating AI in their loop, and as should we. Acquiring knowledge and gaining skills continuously are the best way to keep our brain young, either in the twenties or in the fifties. Work today demands people to know how to use such tools. AI won’t replace software developers, artists, doctors or even pilots. But those who incorporate and those who are learning to integrate AI in their routine, will replace those who aren’t.

                    <p>
                        The release of ChatGPT has boosted the visibility of AI and increased the market capitalization of the technology industry. For example, NASDAQ-100 Composite, an index that contains lots of tech companies, has nearly doubled since 30 November 2022.

                        Nvidia, "the" semi-conducting constructor, leads the tech stock evolution trend. Before the opening of GPT-3 to the public, the company evaluation was oscillating around 17$/share. 6 months later, it doubled and then grew 4 times more before the speech of Jerome Powell on July 31th, announcing that the FED won’t yet lower the interest rate. After two sell off, the stock price fluctuates around 108$/share after the market closed yesterday.

                    <p>
                        Despite these positive increases, some are questioning whether the tech market in general and the "machine learner" one in particular, are being over-valued. Many warnings about the "dot-com bubble" effect are wide-spreading. Economist Ed Yardeni has compared Nvidia to Cisco in <a href="https://www.investors.com/news/technology/nvidia-stock-cisco-dot-com-crash-economist-yardeni/">Investor’s Business Daily</a>, underlining that the current assessment of the semiconductor giant isn’t that much over-valued as Cisco’s in the 2000s, and that the demands are still high.

                    <p>
                        It is hard to predict the future of the AI market cap and of Nvidia. What happened with Cisco in the past, will not necessarily reproduce. However, nothing is guaranteed. Many upcoming events might influence the AI market evolution: the US presidential election, FED interest rate decision, the Middle-East war, etc. "No one exactly knows what will happen with artificial intelligence," said Sameer Samana, senior global market strategist at the Wells Fargo Investment Institute.
