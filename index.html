                    Hi, my name is Huy. I grew up in Vietnam but am currently living in France. I am a PhD Researcher at SONDRA, a French-Singaporean laboratory based in CentraleSupelec. My work aims to detect anomalies in complex-valued Synthetic Aperture Radar imaging, by using Self-Supervised Learning techniques.

                    I love photography, in particular, landscape photography. I have started taking pictures for my friends at school, as a member of the photography club. Then I bought my first camera, the SONY A6000. It was the beginning of a beautiful adventure, a consistent and long self-taught apprenticeship, during which I have become a more mature, independent and responsible person. At that time, I just wanted to make and take better photos. With lots of practice and tutorials, I have learned how to master my camera and the photos retouching.

                    That progressing mindset has affected my professional life. When I decide to spend more time in the university’s library, I keep myself learning something new and doing things better everyday. Graduated in 2022, I’ve spent 2 years looking for a PhD thesis opportunity, while working as a Research Engineer. Since October 2024, I have joined the SONDRA laboratory.
